Data mininig project on an application recommendation system using collaborative mining

Here is the project report of the data mining project we made as a part of our Data Warehousing and Data Mining course
- Made by passing a dataset and applyting the FP-Growth algorithm on it
- Data mining tool, Rapid Miner was used
- The original dataset was collected by conducting a survey using Google forms
- The original dataset was too big for the software to handle so a smaller version of the dataset was passed which gave the desired results
- The results obtained are present in the report
- googleform.pdf is the printable version of the Google form
- googleform.csv is the dataset obtained from the Google form
- datasetoriginal.csv is the original data set in Rapid Miner readable format
- datasetedites.csv is the edited data set with less number of applications and users
